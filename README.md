# Lab 2 - Spring Data

This lab you will continue your previous lab (Lab 1) to implement followings.

###  Phase I
---
* Use n-tier software architecture model.
*  You need to use DTOs.
* Make an ORM relation between `Course` and `Student`.	
	* Create it using `uni-directional` and `Join Column`.
	* Create it using `bi-directional` and `Join Column`.
	* Create it using `uni-directional` and `Join Table`.
	* Create it using `bi-directional` and `Join Table`.

To implement above, you can create different packages for each item in the list.




## Submission

* For each phase (except for Phase IV), create a postman collection that includes sample requests for all of your endpoints.
* Fork the following repository and push your changes.
	* [https://github.com/umur/waa-may-2022-restful.git](https://github.com/umur/waa-may-2022-restful.git)
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)

### Important Notes

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. 
		 * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as one’s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
